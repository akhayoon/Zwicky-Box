# Zwicky Box App

This web app was built with React and allows a user to build and use a Zwicky box. 

As stated in Matt Taylor's excellent paper on the history and practice of the Zwicky Box:

> Employing the Zwicky Box is to use a conceptual tool that can be used to generate more application opportunities and ways to use it. The processes, itself, is a discipline and way of using your innate mental skills. It quickly becomes a way of organizing and thinking - a creative habit. This habit is to start every enquiry with an enhanced understanding of the true size and many ramifications that a question or challenge presents. It forces awareness of hidden design assumption that close down the range of thinking way too early in the creative process.

The Zwicky box app allows for the creation of two dimensional interactive tables:
-  Users can add, edit, and delete categories--as well as items within categories
- A shuffle button automatically generates combinations for users to consider
- Optionally, users can save combinations they like for later reference
- There are a few examples Zwicky Boxes, that users can use to get started with, if desired
